### DEMO

###  OVERVIEW
This is a simple email classification Flask app trained on Logistic Regression. The trained model takes an email text as an input and classification is done to identify spam and ham emails. 

### MOTIVATION
I began my python language learning sessions in june 2023, i was busy learning different parts of python only to end up forgetting because i was not applying the knowledge. This is a remedy to that Challenge. This is my first Machine learning Project and I just came to the realization that i can do a lot with the knowledge that i've been accumulating. let's get to it.
